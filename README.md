## Facility

The tool automatically checks for necessary requirements and installs them if they are not available. However, before you begin, make sure you have access to a `Linux`-based distribution (e.g. `Kali Linux`).

### Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository and access the tool directory.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
bash dynamicIP.sh
```

Follow the instructions on the screen. The tool will configure:
`Tor`: to redirect your traffic.
`Tornet`: to manage the dynamic change of `IP`.
Configuring `Firefox` to Use `Tor`

To browse anonymously using Firefox, configure Tor's `SOCKS` proxy by following these steps:

```
Escribe about:preferences en la barra de direcciones de Firefox.
Despl√°zate hasta Configuraci√≥n de red y haz clic en Configuraci√≥n....
En la ventana emergente:
Selecciona Configuraci√≥n manual de proxy.
Introduce los siguientes datos:
Proxy SOCKS: 127.0.0.1
Puerto: 9050
Activa Proxy SOCKS v5.
Marca Hacer uso de DNS a trav√©s de SOCKS.
Haz clic en Aceptar para guardar los cambios.
```

## Use

Run the tool:

```bash
bash dynamicIP.sh
```

### During execution, the script:

You will configure the necessary components.
It will ask you for the time interval in seconds to dynamically change your `IP`.
It will start changing your `IP` automatically.
Browse with confidence and anonymity.

### Advantages of `Dynamic IP Changer`

`Invisibility`: Changing your `IP` periodically makes your online activity harder to track.
`Global Access`: Bypass geographic restrictions by accessing content blocked in your location.
`Enhanced Privacy`: Protect your identity against trackers, advertisers and potential third-party threats.
`Easy Integration`: Works perfectly with browsers configured to use `Tor`.

## Notes

This tool is designed exclusively for personal and ethical use. Misuse may violate third party privacy laws or terms of service.
To maximize anonymity, always use a secure connection and avoid logging into services that might reveal your identity.

### Requirements

Operating System: `Linux`

### Tools Needed:

`Tor`

`Tornet` (will be installed automatically if not available)
`Python 3` (for virtual environments, if necessary)

### Practical Example

If you want to change your `IP` every 30 seconds:

Run the script:

```bash
bash dynamicIP.sh
```

Enter 30 as the time interval when prompted.

Configure `Firefox` following the instructions provided and start browsing with a new `IP` every half minute.
